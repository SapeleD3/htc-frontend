                            BSI system is an automated system that matches buy and sell orders from
                            different market participants. It connects individual traders, major
                            brokerages and tier-1 liquidity providers in the centralized order book
                            so that they can trade directly among themselves without having to go
                            through a middleman. This trading model enables the participants to
                            enjoy transparent pricing, ultra-tight spreads and fast execution.
